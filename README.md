# Deep Learning Image Classification Project
This project is a deep learning model for image classification. 
I used a dataset from Kaggle and implemented the code in Google Colab. 
The model was trained, tested, and evaluated to achieve accurate predictions.

## Dataset
The dataset was sourced from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mahmoudreda55/satellite-image-classification/data 

# overview of project
This project involves satellite image classification using a hybrid approach that combines a Deep
Belief Network (DBN) with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The dataset used for this
project is the RSI-CB256, which contains four categories of satellite images:
• Cloudy: 1500 images
• Desert: 1131 images
• Green Area: 1500 images
• Water: 1500 images
The goal is to classify satellite images into one of these four categories. The DBN is employed
for feature extraction and pre-training, while the CNN is used for fine-tuning and improving
classification performance.
• Total Images: 5631
• Train-Validation Split:
Training: 4505 images(80%)
Validation: 1126 images (20%)
• Image Size: 64x64 (Resized from original)
• Batch Size: 32
Train Set: 4504 images
Validation Set: 1127 images
